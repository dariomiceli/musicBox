musicBox is music organizing web app using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and React. musicBox allows users to create 'boxes' where they can hold up to 5 tracks. Using the Spotify API, users can search for tracks and add them to thier 'boxes', which they can create and unlimited amount of and can edit and view them from a list. 

The most attractive aspect of musicBox is its minimalist approach to music collections. The deluge of playlists, curated or otherwise, is overwhelming - with many items getting lost in the fold. musicBox allows

Adding an EPK

Work began with basic design, then moved to functionality. Adding events, shareables and EPK change requests was the first function to be compelted. I then moved onto admin permissions and user authentication and authorization. 

### Installation

To run DMEconnect locally:

* Clone this repo to your machine
* Cd into the app
* Run 'bundle install'
* Run 'rails db:create'
* Run 'rails db:migrate'

### Task Management

Trello was the primary task manager for this project. Before I began design any code work I laid out user stories for two different
